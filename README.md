This is a Simple App for searching contacts stored on the phone.

It should have following capabilities:

- Have a single screen with a search box
- Search should work across all the fields like number, name, notes, organization, city [Hint: you can use Lucene]
- The search results should highlight the matching details
- Tapping on a contact should show the contact (raw information is fine too, no need for a specific UI here)
- Use at least 5000 Contacts to search from with random data.

Following third party libraries are used in this project

1) SearchView - https://github.com/lapism/SearchView
